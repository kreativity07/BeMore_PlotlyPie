Let us be “Trees”.
Forbearing & Focused.
They are unmoved from their purpose in life to provide for shade and smiles. Don’t let conditions condition your purpose in life. Like trees, let us be tolerant of unpleasant conditions – biting cold, scorching heat or drowning rains.
Let us “Be More”.

Let us be “Oceans”. 
Euphoric & Endless.
Like oceans, let us wave out vigorously every minute, every day. Let us express thrill and power to surface every big wave ahead in life.
Let us “Be More”.

Let us be “Mountains”.
Robust & Resolute.
With rock-solid will to sustain the toughest of tremors, they are the perfect example of resilience. Let us be rock-solid. Let us be mountains.
Let us “Be More”.

Let us be “Birds”.
Liberated & Limitless.
Unrestrained of their reach, inhibitions and desires, they glide high up above in the skies. Like birds, let us learn to celebrate the company of our own. Here’s a chirping secret – “Only you can decide how far you can soar and how happy you can be.”
Let us “Be More”.

Let us be “Wind”.
Tacit & Tranquil.
Let us recharge our lives with wafts of serenity. Like wind, let’s begin fanning freshness wherever we go. Isn’t all that we need at the end of the day is litle peace?

Let us “Be More”.
